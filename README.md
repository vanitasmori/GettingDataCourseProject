Dear markers,

In order for you to conveniently assess my code, it would be nice of you to:

1) download the data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2) unzip it and set "/UCI HAR Dataset"as the working directory.

3) run the script "run_analysis.R" to produce "tidy.txt" in the above directory.

4) use the following code to read "tidy.txt" for your evaluation and grading:
tidy <- read.table("./tidy.txt", header=T, sep="", row.name=FALSE)


Thank you for your time!
